/**
 * Tells when a QuickShell command left something running behind it (`cmd &`, `nohup ...`) and
 * when that something ends, reporting each change through [onEvent] as `[bgtask] ...`.
 *
 * No process list is read. Every command runs under `setsid` (see QuickShellSession), so its
 * pid is also its process group id and session id, and everything it started stays in that
 * group. `kill -0 -- -pgid` succeeds exactly while some member of the group is alive: one exit
 * status answers "is anything still running?", with no `ps` flags or /proc parsing to get
 * wrong. (`ps -o NAME` is not accepted by every toybox build; its error went to /dev/null and
 * the list came back empty, so nothing was ever reported.)
 *
 * The check runs through the Axeron server, as the server is the same uid as the command.
 * Jobs that start a session of their own (a daemon calling setsid) leave the group and are not
 * followed.
